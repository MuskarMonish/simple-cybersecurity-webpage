            <h2>Data Encryption</h2>
            <p>Data encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into a coded format (ciphertext) to prevent unauthorized access. It is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential even if intercepted by malicious actors.
            <br><strong>Types of Data Encryption:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symmetric Encryption:</strong> Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is widely used for encrypting data at rest.</li>
                <li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption:</strong> Involves a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption. Example: RSA is commonly used for secure data transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> Ensures that data is encrypted on the sender's device and only decrypted on the recipient's device. Example: Messaging apps like WhatsApp use end-to-end encryption to secure conversations.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Importance of Data Encryption:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Protects sensitive information such as personal data, financial records, and intellectual property.</li>
                <li>Mitigates risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access.</li>
                <li>Ensures compliance with regulations and standards such as GDPR and HIPAA.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> When you conduct online banking transactions, your bank encrypts your personal and financial information to protect it from cyber threats. The use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) ensures that data transmitted over the internet is secure and confidential.</p>
            <br><strong>Best Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use strong encryption algorithms and key lengths to enhance security.</li>
                <li>Regularly update encryption methods to address emerging threats.</li>
                <li>Implement key management practices to securely store and handle encryption keys.</li>
                <li>Educate employees about the importance of data encryption and security measures.</li>
            </ul>
