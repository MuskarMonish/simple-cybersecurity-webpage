            <h2>Network Security</h2>
            <p>Network security encompasses policies, practices, and technologies designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and accessibility of computer networks and data. It involves implementing various defenses against unauthorized access and ensuring reliable and secure communication across the network.
            <br><strong>Key Components of Network Security:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Hardware or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> Systems that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and known threats, alerting administrators of potential intrusions.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):</strong> Secure connections over the internet that encrypt data traffic and provide remote users with secure access to a private network.</li>
                <li><strong>Antivirus and Anti-malware Software:</strong> Tools that detect and eliminate malicious software that could compromise network security.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Dividing a network into smaller segments to limit the spread of threats and improve overall security management.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Common Threats to Network Security:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Attempts by individuals to gain access to a network without permission, often using stolen credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Attacks that overwhelm network resources, rendering them unavailable to legitimate users.</li>
                <li><strong>Malware Infections:</strong> Introduction of malicious software into the network that can disrupt operations or steal sensitive data.</li>
                <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:</strong> Eavesdropping on or altering communications between two parties without their knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> An organization implements a robust firewall and IDS to protect its network from unauthorized access and attacks. When an attacker attempts to breach the network, the IDS detects the suspicious activity and alerts the security team, enabling them to take immediate action to prevent a breach.
            </p>
            <br><strong>Best Practices for Network Security:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularly update and patch network devices and software to address vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication for network access.</li>
                <li>Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses.</li>
                <li>Implement a comprehensive incident response plan to address and manage security breaches effectively.</li>
            </ul>
