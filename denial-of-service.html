            <h2>Denial of Service (DoS)</h2>
            <p>A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to make a service unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with a flood of illegitimate requests. This can lead to reduced performance or complete shutdown of the targeted service.
            <br><strong>Types of DoS Attacks:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Volume-Based Attacks:</strong> These attacks aim to consume the bandwidth of the target. Example: UDP floods, ICMP floods.</li>
                <li><strong>Protocol Attacks:</strong> These target weaknesses in the protocols of the network. Example: SYN floods, Ping of Death.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Layer Attacks:</strong> These focus on exhausting server resources. Example: HTTP floods that aim to overwhelm web servers.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):</strong> A more sophisticated form of DoS, where multiple compromised systems (often part of a botnet) launch an attack simultaneously, making it harder to mitigate.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> The 2016 DDoS attack on Dyn, a DNS service provider, disrupted major websites like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit by overwhelming Dyn's servers with traffic from a large botnet.</p>
            <br><strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing rate limiting to control the number of requests a server can handle.</li>
                <li>Using firewalls and intrusion detection systems to filter out malicious traffic.</li>
                <li>Employing content delivery networks (CDNs) to absorb and mitigate attack traffic.</li>
                <li>Having a robust incident response plan to quickly react to attacks.</li>
            </ul>
