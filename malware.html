            <h2>Malware</h2>
            <p>Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer system, server, client, or computer network. It is a broad category that includes various types of harmful software aimed at exploiting, disrupting, or gaining unauthorized access to systems and data.
            <br><strong>Types of Malware:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Self-replicating programs that attach themselves to legitimate files and spread when the infected file is executed.</li>
                <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Standalone malware that replicates itself to spread to other computers, often exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> Malicious programs disguised as legitimate software that, once installed, can provide unauthorized access to the attacker.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, demanding payment for the decryption key.</li>
                <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Software that secretly monitors and collects user information, often without their consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Adware:</strong> Software that automatically displays or downloads advertisements, often bundled with free software.</li>
                <li><strong>Rootkits:</strong> Tools that allow attackers to maintain control over a system while concealing their presence.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>How Malware is Delivered:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Phishing emails with malicious attachments or links.</li>
                <li>Compromised websites that host malware for download.</li>
                <li>Infected software downloads from untrusted sources.</li>
                <li>Removable media, such as USB drives, containing malware.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> A company falls victim to a ransomware attack, where employees cannot access critical files. The attackers demand payment in cryptocurrency for the decryption key, forcing the organization to weigh the cost of paying the ransom against the potential loss of data and operational downtime.
            </p>
            <br><strong>Best Practices for Protecting Against Malware:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Install and regularly update antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and remove threats.</li>
                <li>Educate employees about safe browsing habits and recognizing phishing attempts.</li>
                <li>Regularly back up data to secure locations to mitigate the impact of ransomware.</li>
                <li>Implement network security measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to monitor and block malicious traffic.</li>
            </ul>
