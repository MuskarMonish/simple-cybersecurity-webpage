            <h2>Data Loss Prevention (DLP)</h2>
            <p>Data Loss Prevention (DLP) refers to a set of tools and processes designed to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users. DLP solutions help organizations identify, monitor, and protect data across various environments, including endpoints, networks, and cloud storage.
            <br><strong>Key Components:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Discovery:</strong> Identifying and classifying sensitive data stored within an organization.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Monitoring:</strong> Tracking data movement and usage to detect any unauthorized access or transfer.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Implementing policies and controls to prevent data loss or leaks.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Common DLP Techniques:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Endpoint DLP:</strong> Protects sensitive data on user devices such as laptops and smartphones.</li>
                <li><strong>Network DLP:</strong> Monitors and controls data in transit across networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud DLP:</strong> Secures data stored in cloud applications and services.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> A company may use DLP software to prevent employees from sending sensitive customer data via personal email accounts or uploading it to unsecured cloud storage services.</p>
            <br><strong>Best Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement data classification policies to identify sensitive information.</li>
                <li>Regularly train employees on data security best practices and DLP policies.</li>
                <li>Continuously monitor and update DLP policies to adapt to new threats and regulations.</li>
                <li>Use encryption and access controls to further protect sensitive data.</li>
            </ul>
