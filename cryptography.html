            <h2>Cryptography</h2>
            <p>Cryptography is the practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the original data. It employs algorithms and keys to encrypt and decrypt data, thereby protecting it from unauthorized access.
            <br><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Encryption, decryption, symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography, hash functions, and digital signatures.
            <br><strong>Types of Cryptography:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symmetric Cryptography:</strong> The same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).</li>
                <li><strong>Asymmetric Cryptography:</strong> Uses a pair of keys (public and private) for encryption and decryption. Example: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman).</li>
                <li><strong>Hash Functions:</strong> Converts data into a fixed-size hash value, which is not reversible. Example: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm).</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) uses SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt the data exchanged between a web server and a client, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data in transit.</p>
            <br><strong>Best Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Use strong encryption algorithms and keep encryption keys secure.</li>
                <li>Regularly update cryptographic protocols to safeguard against vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Implement digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages.</li>
                <li>Educate users on the importance of cryptography in securing communications.</li>
            </ul>
