            <h2>Application Security</h2>
            <p>Application security encompasses the measures and practices implemented during the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to prevent security vulnerabilities in applications. These measures are applied both to applications in development and production environments.
            <br><strong>Key Areas:</strong> Secure coding practices, authentication and authorization, input validation, encryption, and vulnerability assessments.
            <br><strong>Common Threats:</strong> SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, and security misconfigurations.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Input validation helps prevent SQL injection attacks, where an attacker injects malicious SQL queries into a web form to gain access to the database or manipulate it. Modern web frameworks help mitigate this risk by automatically escaping user inputs.</p>
            <br><strong>Best Practices:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Implement secure coding standards such as OWASP top 10.</li>
                <li>Use proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Apply encryption to sensitive data both in transit and at rest.</li>
                <li>Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing.</li>
            </ul>
