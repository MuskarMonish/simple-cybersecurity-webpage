            <h2>Phishing</h2>
            <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where cybercriminals deceive individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details by pretending to be a trustworthy entity. These attacks often occur via email, instant messaging, or websites that mimic legitimate services.
            <br><strong>Key Types of Phishing Attacks:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate sources, tricking recipients into clicking on malicious links or providing sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> A targeted phishing attack aimed at a specific individual or organization, often using personalized information to increase the chances of success.</li>
                <li><strong>Whaling:</strong> A type of spear phishing attack that targets high-level executives or important figures within an organization.</li>
                <li><strong>Clone Phishing:</strong> A legitimate email is cloned and resent with malicious attachments or links, tricking users into interacting with them.</li>
                <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Phishing attacks conducted over the phone (voice phishing), where attackers pose as legitimate entities to extract sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing conducted via SMS (text message), where attackers send deceptive messages containing malicious links or asking for sensitive details.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Common Signs of Phishing Attacks:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Emails or messages from unknown or suspicious senders.</li>
                <li>Urgent or threatening language encouraging immediate action.</li>
                <li>Unfamiliar links or attachments, often asking for sensitive information.</li>
                <li>Poor grammar, spelling mistakes, or inconsistencies in email format.</li>
                <li>Requests for confidential information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> A user receives an email that appears to be from their bank, asking them to reset their password by clicking on a link. The link redirects them to a fake website designed to look like the bankâ€™s login page, where the user inadvertently provides their login credentials to the attacker.
            </p>
            <br><strong>How to Protect Against Phishing:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Verify the legitimacy of unexpected emails or messages by contacting the sender through official channels.</li>
                <li>Look for signs of phishing, such as suspicious email addresses, unusual language, or requests for sensitive information.</li>
                <li>Do not click on unknown links or download attachments from untrusted sources.</li>
                <li>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to sensitive accounts.</li>
                <li>Keep software and browsers up to date with the latest security patches.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Best Practices for Organizations:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct regular phishing awareness training for employees.</li>
                <li>Use email filters to block suspicious or known phishing emails.</li>
                <li>Enable security features like URL filtering and malware protection.</li>
                <li>Encourage a security-first culture where employees report suspicious emails to the IT department.</li>
            </ul>
