            <h2>Ethical Hacking</h2>
            <p>Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, refers to the practice of intentionally probing and testing a computer system, network, or web application to identify security vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could exploit. Ethical hackers help organizations strengthen their security defenses by discovering and fixing vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
            <br><strong>Key Principles of Ethical Hacking:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legality:</strong> Ethical hackers have proper authorization to perform tests on a system.</li>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> The vulnerabilities discovered are kept confidential and shared only with the authorized parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> The systems tested must not be damaged or compromised during the process.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Steps in Ethical Hacking:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> Gathering information about the target system or network.</li>
                <li><strong>Scanning:</strong> Actively probing the target to find entry points and vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Gaining Access:</strong> Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain control or access to the target system.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining Access:</strong> Sustaining access to the system to gather further information or exploit other areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Covering Tracks:</strong> Ensuring activities are undetectable by removing signs of the hack.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Ethical hackers prepare a detailed report that includes identified vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Types of Ethical Hacking:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web Application Testing:</strong> Identifying vulnerabilities in websites and web applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Network Penetration Testing:</strong> Assessing network infrastructure for weak points.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Using psychological manipulation to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>Wireless Network Testing:</strong> Probing wireless networks for vulnerabilities in encryption and access controls.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> A company hires an ethical hacker to test the security of their web application. The hacker discovers an SQL injection vulnerability, allowing unauthorized access to the companyâ€™s database. The ethical hacker reports the issue to the company, which then fixes the flaw before any malicious actor can exploit it.
            </p>
            <br><strong>Best Practices for Ethical Hacking:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Obtain proper authorization before conducting any tests.</li>
                <li>Use appropriate and lawful hacking tools and techniques.</li>
                <li>Prepare a comprehensive report with recommendations for improvement.</li>
                <li>Conduct regular penetration testing to keep systems secure as new threats emerge.</li>
            </ul>
