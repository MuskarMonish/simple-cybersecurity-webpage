            <h2>Insider Threats</h2>
            <p>Insider threats refer to security risks that originate from within an organization, typically involving employees, contractors, or business partners who have inside information concerning the organizationâ€™s security practices, data, or computer systems. These threats can be malicious or unintentional and pose significant risks to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
            <br><strong>Types of Insider Threats:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Malicious Insiders:</strong> Employees who intentionally steal data or sabotage systems, often motivated by financial gain or revenge.</li>
                <li><strong>Negligent Insiders:</strong> Employees who unintentionally cause security breaches through careless actions, such as falling for phishing scams or mishandling sensitive data.</li>
                <li><strong>Compromised Insiders:</strong> Employees whose accounts have been taken over by external attackers, allowing them access to sensitive information.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Indicators of Insider Threats:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Unusual access patterns, such as accessing files not typically needed for a job role.</li>
                <li>Frequent downloading of sensitive information, especially shortly before an employee leaves the company.</li>
                <li>Using unauthorized devices or external storage media to access company data.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> An employee with access to sensitive customer data begins downloading large volumes of information shortly before resigning. This behavior raises a red flag for the organization, prompting an investigation that reveals the employee's intention to sell the data to a competitor.
            </p>
            <br><strong>Best Practices for Mitigating Insider Threats:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement strict access controls and the principle of least privilege, ensuring employees only have access to the data necessary for their roles.</li>
                <li>Conduct regular security awareness training to educate employees about recognizing and reporting suspicious activities.</li>
                <li>Monitor user behavior and implement anomaly detection to identify unusual access patterns.</li>
                <li>Establish a clear exit process that includes revoking access rights and conducting exit interviews to assess potential risks.</li>
            </ul>
