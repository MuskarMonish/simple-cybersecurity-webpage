            <h2>Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)</h2>
            <p>An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a prolonged and targeted cyberattack where an attacker gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period. The primary goal is usually espionage or data theft rather than immediate damage.
            <br><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong> Targeted attacks, stealthy presence, advanced techniques, continuous monitoring, and multiple stages of attack.
            <br><strong>Phases:</strong> Reconnaissance, initial intrusion, establishing foothold, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and maintaining persistence.
            <br><strong>Industries Targeted:</strong> Governments, financial institutions, healthcare, critical infrastructure, technology, research, and media.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> APT28 (Fancy Bear), a Russian cyber-espionage group, targeted the U.S. Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election, using phishing emails and malware to breach the system.</p>
